In  the  recent  years,  a  number  of  researches  areperformed  on  understanding  the  knowledge  dynamics  of  crowdsourced  portals  like  Wikipedia,  Reddit,  Stack  Overflow  etc.  Inorder  to  improve  the  cost  in  terms  of  time  and  efficiency,  thereis need of standard data representation format for all the crowd-sourced portals and also there is need of some proper tools andlibraries  for  analysis  of  data  sets  from  these  portals.  In  [1],  themethodology to convert dataset of Wikipedia and Stack Exchangeinto the standard data representation format and proper analysistools have been developed. The knowledge data analysis portal istermed  as  Knowledge  Data  Analysis  and  Processing  platform(KDAP)   and   the   standard   representation   of   data   of   portalsare  proposed  as  Knowledge  Markup  Language  (Knol-ML),  anddataset  converted  into  Knol-ML  format  are  called  KnowledgeAnalysis  and  Retrieval  (KAR)  dataset.In  this  paper,  we  present  the  building  the  KDAP  model  forcrowd  sourced  portal  Reddit.  In  this  model,  We  are  buildinglibraries and tools for KDAP, which will give Reddit data Knol-ML  format  and  proper  analysis  tool  so  that  researchers  canuse  this  KDAP  model  for  the  analysis  of  Reddit  dataset  veryefficiently
