In  the  recent  years,  a  number  of  researches  are performed  on  understanding  the  knowledge  dynamics  of  crowdsourced  portals  like  Wikipedia,  Reddit,  Stack  Overflow  etc.  Inorder  to  improve  the  cost  in  terms  of  time  and  efficiency,  there is need of standard data representation format for all the crowd-sourced portals and also there is need of some proper tools and libraries  for  analysis  of  data  sets  from  these  portals.  In  [1],  the methodology to convert dataset of Wikipedia and Stack Exchange into the standard data representation format and proper analysis tools have been developed. The knowledge data analysis portal is termed  as  Knowledge  Data  Analysis  and  Processing  platform(KDAP)   and   the   standard   representation   of   data   of   portals are  proposed  as  Knowledge  Markup  Language  (Knol-ML),  and dataset  converted  into  Knol-ML  format  are  called  Knowledge Analysis  and  Retrieval  (KAR)  dataset. In  this  paper,  we  present  the  building  the  KDAP  model  for crowd  sourced  portal  Reddit.  In  this  model,  We  are  building libraries and tools for KDAP, which will give Reddit data Knol-ML  format  and  proper  analysis  tool  so  that  researchers  canuse  this  KDAP  model  for  the  analysis  of  Reddit  dataset  very efficiently.
